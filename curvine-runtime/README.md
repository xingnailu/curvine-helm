# Curvine Runtime Helm Chart

Helm chart for deploying a Curvine runtime cluster on Kubernetes.

## Naming

- Source directory: `curvine-runtime/`
- Published chart name: `curvine`
- Recommended release name: `curvine`
- Recommended namespace: `curvine`

When installing from a Helm repository, use `curvineio/curvine`. When installing from this repository, use `./curvine-runtime`.

## Versioning and Images

This chart leaves `values.image.tag` empty by default. Templates resolve the effective image tag
from `Chart.appVersion`:

| `Chart.appVersion` | Default image tag |
| --- | --- |
| `0.3.0` | `v0.3.0` |
| `latest` | `latest` |

On versioned releases, `Chart.version` and `Chart.appVersion` match. On `main` branch test
packages, `Chart.version` is `0.0.0-dev` while `appVersion` is `latest`.

See the repository [README](../README.md#versioning-model) for the full version mapping and
release workflow.

Confirm these prerequisites first:

- Kubernetes 1.20+
- Helm 3.x
- One of these storage options:
  - a default `StorageClass`
  - explicit `storageClass` values in your values file
  - `hostPath` storage on bare metal
- Enough cluster capacity for the requested CPU and memory
- If you use the production or bare-metal examples:
  - node labels already exist
  - required taints are tolerated
  - privileged Pods and `hostNetwork` are allowed when applicable

### OpenKruise (optional)

By default `openKruise.enabled=false`. The chart uses standard `apps/v1` StatefulSets and does not install OpenKruise.

Set `openKruise.enabled=true` when you need:

- Advanced StatefulSet features (in-place image updates)
- PersistentPodState topology pinning for master pods

Enabling OpenKruise installs the `kruise` subchart (v1.9.0) into `kruise-system` as part of the same `helm upgrade --install` command. Override subchart settings under the top-level `kruise:` values key.

If OpenKruise is already installed cluster-wide, set `openKruise.enabled=true` for Curvine Kruise API usage and consider `kruise.crds.managed=false` to avoid reinstalling CRDs.

The chart defaults are intentionally conservative so a first deployment is less likely to end in `Pending`.
The chart also includes `values.schema.json` so invalid values can be rejected before rendering.

## Install

### From The Public Helm Repository

```bash
helm repo add curvineio https://curvineio.github.io/curvine-doc/helm-charts
helm repo update

helm upgrade --install curvine curvineio/curvine \
  -n curvine \
  --create-namespace
```

### From Local Source

```bash
helm upgrade --install curvine ./curvine-runtime \
  -n curvine \
  --create-namespace
```

### Bootstrap Empty Master Storage

`cluster.formatMaster` defaults to `false` to protect existing master metadata
and Raft journals. Empty master storage needs an explicit bootstrap:

```bash
helm upgrade --install curvine ./curvine-runtime \
  -n curvine \
  --create-namespace \
  --set cluster.formatMaster=true

kubectl rollout status statefulset/curvine-master -n curvine

helm upgrade --install curvine ./curvine-runtime \
  -n curvine \
  --set cluster.formatMaster=false
```

Do this only for a new cluster or a rebuild where data loss is acceptable. For
an existing HA master, never clear one ordinal and restart it empty with
`cluster.formatMaster=false`; copy a consistent meta and journal snapshot from a
healthy master or rebuild the whole cluster.

### With Example Values

Development:

```bash
helm upgrade --install curvine ./curvine-runtime \
  -n curvine \
  --create-namespace \
  -f ./curvine-runtime/examples/values-dev.yaml
```

Production:

```bash
helm upgrade --install curvine ./curvine-runtime \
  -n curvine \
  --create-namespace \
  -f ./curvine-runtime/examples/values-prod.yaml
```

Bare metal:

```bash
helm upgrade --install curvine ./curvine-runtime \
  -n curvine \
  --create-namespace \
  -f ./curvine-runtime/examples/values-baremetal.yaml
```

When Master metadata or journal storage uses `hostPath`, the chart treats the
data as node-local. For multi-Master deployments, it adds required Pod
anti-affinity so each Master ordinal stays on a distinct node and two Master
pods cannot share the same node-local RocksDB paths.

To pin master pods to their original nodes across restarts, set
`openKruise.enabled=true` and configure `master.persistentTopology` (see the
bare-metal example).

Master startup is intentionally protected by `master.startupProbe`. A Master
does not open the RPC port until Raft snapshot restore and metadata tree rebuild
finish. In production, a 700 MiB checkpoint has taken about 4 minutes to rebuild,
so short liveness-only probing can kill a healthy restore loop before the process
can become ready.

Do not use the production or bare-metal examples unchanged on a generic cluster. Edit storage classes, labels, and paths first.

## Transfer Service

Set `transfer.enabled=true` to deploy the standalone Transfer service. The chart
creates an internal `ClusterIP` service and writes its Kubernetes DNS name into
`[transfer].hostname`; Curvine then infers the client and Worker RPC endpoint.
No `transfer.endpoints` value is required.

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  storeUrl: ""
  replicas: 1
  storage:
    size: "1Gi"
    storageClass: ""  # Empty uses the cluster default StorageClass
  rpcPort: 9010
  webPort: 9011
```

An empty `storeUrl` keeps Curvine's default single-instance SQLite store at
`/app/curvine/data/transfer/transfer.db`. The chart creates a `ReadWriteOnce`
PVC and mounts it at that directory. Leave `transfer.storage.storageClass`
empty to omit `storageClassName` and use the cluster default StorageClass;
set it to pin a specific class. A cluster without a matching or default
StorageClass leaves the PVC Pending instead of silently using temporary
storage. Multiple Transfer replicas require a shared MySQL store and the chart
rejects other configurations:

The SQLite Deployment uses `Recreate` to detach its `ReadWriteOnce` volume
before a replacement Pod starts. Its PVC is retained by `helm uninstall`; delete
it explicitly only when discarding the Transfer metadata.

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  storeUrl: "mysql://<user>:<password>@mysql.example:3306/curvine_transfer"
  replicas: 2
```

`transfer.enabled`/`storeUrl`/`replicas`/`rpcPort`/`webPort` are chart-managed:
the generated Service, Deployment and `[transfer]` configuration always use the
same values. The hostname is always the generated Kubernetes Service DNS. Do
not set these keys under `configOverrides.transfer`.

All other supported `[transfer]` settings use the existing pass-through map:

```yaml
configOverrides:
  transfer:
    max_running_transfers: 128
    lease_timeout: "180s"
    terminal_retention: "336h"
    cv_metadata_reader: "replica"
```

| `[transfer]` parameter | Helm setting | Default and behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `transfer.enabled` | `false`; creates no Transfer workload until enabled. |
| `store_url` | `transfer.storeUrl` | Empty infers `sqlite://data/transfer/transfer.db`. |
| SQLite PVC capacity | `transfer.storage.size` | `1Gi`; created only when `storeUrl` is empty. |
| SQLite PVC StorageClass | `transfer.storage.storageClass` | Empty omits `storageClassName` (cluster default); set to pin a class. |
| `hostname` | Generated | The internal Transfer Service DNS. |
| `rpc_port` | `transfer.rpcPort` | `9010`. |
| `web_port` | `transfer.webPort` | `9011`. |
| Node selector | `transfer.nodeSelector` | `{}`; same semantics as master/worker. |
| `instance_id` | `configOverrides.transfer.instance_id` | Empty generates a unique instance ID. |
| `endpoints` | `configOverrides.transfer.endpoints` | Empty infers the generated Service DNS and RPC port. |
| `cv_metadata_reader` | `configOverrides.transfer.cv_metadata_reader` | `auto`, which resolves to `replica`. |
| `max_running_transfers` | `configOverrides.transfer.max_running_transfers` | `64`. |
| `lease_timeout` | `configOverrides.transfer.lease_timeout` | `120s`. |
| `terminal_retention` | `configOverrides.transfer.terminal_retention` | `168h`. |

The pass-through also accepts the deprecated compatibility keys `store_type`,
`sqlite_path`, and `mysql_url`; use `storeUrl` instead. Fields that the server
marks as internal or derived are not configuration options in any deployment
mode.

The Transfer web endpoint exposes `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` on
`transfer.webPort`. The RPC service listens on `transfer.rpcPort` inside the
cluster.

## Web Admin Console

Set `webAdmin.enabled=true` to deploy the standalone `curvine-web` admin
console. This is separate from `master.webPort` (master Prometheus `/metrics`).

```yaml
webAdmin:
  enabled: true
  replicas: 1
  port: 9000
  auth:
    create: true
    username: admin
    password: admin
```

The chart writes `[web].hostname` / `[web].port`, creates a ClusterIP Service,
and starts the process with `/entrypoint.sh web start`. Login uses
`CURVINE_WEB_USERNAME` / `CURVINE_WEB_PASSWORD` from a chart-managed Secret, or
set `webAdmin.auth.existingSecret` to reuse an existing one.

Do not set `hostname` or `port` under `configOverrides.web`; other flat `[web]`
keys may be passed through that map. Nested `[web.observability]` keeps the
binary defaults unless you extend the ConfigMap separately.

## Verify

Run these commands immediately after install or upgrade:

```bash
helm status curvine -n curvine
kubectl get statefulset,pod,pvc -n curvine
kubectl get events -n curvine --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

Access the master web UI:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n curvine svc/curvine-master 9000:9000
```

## Standard Operator Workflows

### Upgrade In Place

```bash
helm upgrade --install curvine curvineio/curvine \
  -n curvine \
  -f values.yaml
```

Use this flow for:

- image changes
- resource tuning
- worker replica changes
- config changes

Do not change `master.replicas` during an in-place upgrade.

### Migrating from implicit OpenKruise usage

Older chart versions rendered master StatefulSets as `apps.kruise.io/v1beta1` when
using `hostPath` storage with `master.persistentTopology.enabled=true`, even if
`openKruise.enabled=false`. Current versions only use the Kruise API when
`openKruise.enabled=true`.

If you upgraded from that behavior:

- Set `openKruise.enabled=true` before upgrading to keep Advanced StatefulSet semantics, or
- Accept that the master StatefulSet apiVersion may change to `apps/v1` and plan accordingly

### Roll Back

```bash
helm history curvine -n curvine
helm rollback curvine <revision> -n curvine
```

### Re-Deploy While Preserving Data

This path keeps StatefulSet PVCs:

```bash
helm uninstall curvine -n curvine

helm upgrade --install curvine curvineio/curvine \
  -n curvine \
  --create-namespace \
  -f values.yaml
```

Rules:

- reuse the same release name
- reuse the same namespace
- do not delete PVCs

If old PVCs were already unresolved, the re-deployed Pods may remain `Pending` for the same reason.

### Destroy And Rebuild

This path deletes data:

```bash
helm uninstall curvine -n curvine
kubectl delete pvc -n curvine -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=curvine
kubectl delete namespace curvine
```

Use this only when data loss is acceptable.

## Values And Examples

Inspect current defaults:

```bash
helm show values curvineio/curvine
```

Or locally:

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' ./curvine-runtime/values.yaml
```

Included example files:

- `examples/values-dev.yaml`
- `examples/values-prod.yaml`
- `examples/values-baremetal.yaml`

## Troubleshooting

If a Pod is `Pending`, start with:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n curvine
kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name> -n curvine
kubectl get storageclass
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
kubectl get events -n curvine --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

## Important Behavior Notes

- `helm uninstall` removes workloads but leaves StatefulSet PVCs behind
- `master.replicas` must stay stable across in-place upgrades
- Logs are often not useful for `Pending` Pods because containers may never start
